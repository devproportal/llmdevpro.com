## Introduction
OpenAI has elevated enterprise coding AI with the launch of GPT 5.1 Codex Max on November 19, 2025—a revolutionary programming agent engineered to tackle long-duration, high-complexity software tasks. Unlike traditional coding tools, this model transcends fixed context limits via proprietary "compaction" tech, enabling it to work autonomously for 24+ hours, iterate on projects, fix test failures, and deliver polished results—all while slashing token costs by 30%.

Built for software engineers, researchers, and enterprise dev teams, GPT 5.1 Codex Max outperforms competitors like Gemini 3 Pro on key coding benchmarks, adds native Windows environment support, and integrates seamlessly with modern development workflows (CLI, IDEs, code review tools). It’s not just a code helper—it’s a persistent, efficient coding partner that shifts workflows from "writing code" to "defining goals and auditing outputs."

Its standout edge lies in the compaction mechanism: when approaching context limits, the model auto-summarizes key code, decisions, and test results (discarding redundancy), opens new context windows, and maintains task coherence—eliminating "context amnesia" that plagues traditional models. This makes it the first coding AI capable of end-to-end project delivery without human context resets.

## Key Features (GPT 5.1 Codex Max Exclusive)
### 1. Breakthrough Compaction Technology
- Cross-window continuity: Processes millions of tokens across multiple context windows, handling full-codebase refactors, long-term debugging, and multi-hour projects seamlessly.
- Smart context retention: Auto-preserves critical logic, code snippets, and task goals during compression—no loss of project coherence.
- Enables 24+ hour autonomous workflows: Independently iterates code, fixes test failures, and delivers finished outputs (e.g., full web apps, simulators) without human intervention.

### 2. Enterprise-Grade Coding & Debugging
- Benchmark-leading performance: Outperforms Gemini 3 Pro on SWE-Bench Verified (77.9% vs. 76.2%) and Terminal-Bench 2.0 (58.1% vs. 54.2%), excels at system-level coding tasks.
- Windows native optimization: First Codex model tailored for Windows environments, with enhanced support for PowerShell, Windows file paths, and desktop app development.
- Deep debugging autonomy: Analyzes logs, identifies root causes of failures, tests fixes, and avoids redundant attempts—cuts debugging time for complex issues by 40%+.

### 3. Multi-Mode Reasoning & Efficiency
- Adjustable推理 intensity: Medium mode (30% fewer tokens, balanced speed/accuracy) for daily tasks; Extra High mode (extended thinking time) for high-stakes, quality-focused work (e.g., research tools, critical software).
- Token cost savings: Reduced thinking token usage translates to lower operational costs for large-scale projects—ideal for enterprise dev teams scaling AI workflows.
- Proactive problem-solving: Demonstrates initiative in feature implementation (e.g., adding rich details to SVG designs, optimizing code structure without explicit prompts) vs. generic AI models.
